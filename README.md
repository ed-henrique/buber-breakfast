## Architecture Choices

- CRUD REST API
- Best Practices
- Some Functional Programming
- Some DDD (Domain-Driven Design)

## What I learned

- How to build a simple CRUD API in .NET 7
- How to handle errors gracefully in .NET 7
- How a Backend Service Architecture is structured
- How to use REST Client and .http files to test API requests (‚ù§Ô∏è Most valuable by far)
- Prioritizing error flow over readability (ü§î I don't know if this always applies though)
